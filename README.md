# Monotype-Assignment
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of cats. The GAN architecture consists of a Generator and a Discriminator, both implemented using PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of cat images, and the performance is monitored through the convergence of the training and validation loss.
